# Ryan's UNSW Computer Science Review

I have been studying Maths and Computer Science at UNSW since 2021, and I want to share my experiences with new upcoming students so they know what they're getting into and have potentially an idea of what electives they may want to take. Note that these reviews will be biased, opinionated and subjective based on my experience with them when I took them. Courses are different for everyone, I myself, am a more practical programmer, thus I enjoyed more practical courses rather than theory. If I mention the structure or staff having a poor experience, they may have improved by now.

## Core Courses

### COMP1511

- Term Taken: 21T1
- Lecturer in Term Taken: Marc Chee
- Other Lecturers: Sasha Vassar
- Difficulty: ðŸŸ¢ Easy

COMP1511 is the introductory course for computer science at UNSW. No prior coding knowledge is required, but certainly helps to hit the ground running. It is taught using C as the coding language, and focuses on fundamentals, arrays, looping, pointers, structs, functions, linked lists, and a small amount of memory allocation.

Each week consists of two 2-hour lectures and a TLB (tutorial lab) which is a one-hour tutorial followed by a 2-hour lab. The tutorial will go over content taught in the previous week of lectures, and the lab gives you time to work on the weekly lab exercises. The lab exercises are usually pretty straightforward, though some challenge ones are designed to throw off even the strongest coders. Most weeks will also have a weekly test, which consist of three easier exercises focusing on reaffirming content from a couple weeks beforehand. The two or three assignments allow you to express your understanding of the content in a more involved (and I found, fun) way. Lastly, the final exam (which is probably in person) features some theory and practical questions similar to the weekly tests, but the programming questions often scales in difficulty the further into the exam.

### COMP1521

- Term Taken: 21T2
- Lecturer in Term Taken: Sri Parameswaran
- Other Lecturers: Andrew Taylor
- Difficulty: ðŸŸ¡ Easy-Medium

COMP1521 is one of the next steps after COMP1511, and is more of an introduction to low-level programming. You start by learning MIPS (an assembly language) which is quite different from any other language you will experience. After that, you move to system level programming in C, including bitwise operations and file writing.

The weekly schedule for COMP1521 follows the exact same lecture + TLB + Weekly Labs and Weekly Quiz as COMP1511. Only real difference is the final exam only has programming questions in it. I would strongly recommend taking this in a term with Andrew Taylor, as I think his lecturing style is a much better experience than Sri's. With this, the assignments usually become 'easy to pass / credit, medium to Distinction, hard to HD' and the exam becomes a little harder.
