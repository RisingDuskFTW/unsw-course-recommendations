# Ryan's UNSW Computer Science Review

I have been studying Maths and Computer Science at UNSW since 2021, and I want to share my experiences with new upcoming students so they know what they're getting into and have potentially an idea of what electives they may want to take. Note that these reviews will be biased, opinionated and subjective based on my experience with them when I took them. Courses are different for everyone; I am a more practical programmer, and so I enjoyed more practical courses rather than theory. If I mention the structure or staff having a poor experience, they may have improved by now.

## Core Courses

### COMP1511 â€“Â Programming Fundamentals

- Term Taken: 21T1
- Lecturer in Term Taken: Marc Chee
- Other Lecturers: Sasha Vassar
- Prerequisite: None
- Difficulty: ðŸŸ¢ Easy

COMP1511 is the introductory course for computer science at UNSW. No prior coding knowledge is required but certainly helps to hit the ground running. It is taught using C as the coding language and focuses on fundamentals, arrays, looping, pointers, structs, functions, linked lists, and a small amount of memory allocation.

Each week consists of two 2-hour lectures and a TLB (tutorial lab) which is a one-hour tutorial followed by a 2-hour lab. The tutorial will go over content taught in the previous week of lectures, and the lab gives you time to work on the weekly lab exercises. The lab exercises are usually pretty straightforward, though some challenge ones are designed to throw off even the strongest coders. Most weeks will also have a weekly test, which consists of three easier exercises focusing on reaffirming content from a couple of weeks beforehand. The two or three assignments allow you to express your understanding of the content in a more involved (and I found, fun) way. Lastly, the final exam (which is probably in person) features some theory and practical questions similar to the weekly tests, but the programming questions often scale in difficulty further into the exam.

### COMP1521 â€“Â Computer Systems Fundamentals

- Term Taken: 21T2
- Lecturer in Term Taken: Sri Parameswaran
- Other Lecturers: Andrew Taylor
- Prerequisite: COMP1511
- Difficulty: ðŸŸ¡ Easy - Medium

COMP1521 is one of the next steps after COMP1511 and is more of an introduction to low-level programming. You start by learning MIPS (an assembly language) which is quite different from any other language you will experience. After that, you move to system-level programming in C, including bitwise operations and file writing. The difference in difficulty purely depends on how quickly you take to this different style of programming.

The weekly schedule for COMP1521 follows the same lecture + TLB + Weekly Labs and Weekly Quiz as COMP1511. The only real difference is the final exam only has programming questions in it. I would strongly recommend taking this in a term with Andrew Taylor, as I think his lecturing style is a much better experience than Sri's. With this, the assignments usually become 'easy to pass / credit, medium to Distinction, hard to HD' and the exam becomes a little harder. I would also recommend taking this course a bit later than you think. The next two courses both open up a lot more electives, so consider that when choosing when to take this.

### COMP1531 â€“Â Software Engineering Fundamentals

- Term Taken: 21T3
- Lecturer in Term Taken: Hayden Smith
- Other Lecturers: Jake Renzella
- Prerequisite: COMP1511
- Difficulty: ðŸŸ¡ Easy - Hard

COMP1521 is one of the next steps after COMP1511 and is an introduction to group projects and the software development life cycle. Becoming acclimated to group work is incredibly important for work after uni, so be prepared to put in a decent bit more time here than in COMP1511. When I took it, the coding language was Python, but it has since moved to JavaScript. Hayden is a fantastic lecturer though, so you will be in safe hands.

The weekly schedule for COMP1531 follows the same lecture + TLB + Weekly Labs as COMP1511, minus the weekly tests. The exam is much the same, but without that scaling difficulty for the most part. However, in place of the two assignments, there is a group project for 4-5 students across the whole term. As of 22T3, you are only allowed to preference one person from your TLB class, so there is going to be variance in who your random teammates are. If they happen to be like-minded in their goals? Cool! The term will be a bit easier. But if they don't contribute as much as they should, the project can easily become a huge time sink for you. Keep that in mind with choosing your tutorial time. (A proven strategy has been to occupy over half of the tutorial with friends so you're more likely to get people you can work with.)

### COMP2521 â€“Â Data Structures and Algorithms

- Term Taken: 21T3
- Lecturer in Term Taken: Ashesh Mahidadia
- Other Lecturers: Others
- Prerequisite: COMP1511
- Difficulty: ðŸŸ  Medium - Hard

COMP2521 is one of the next steps after COMP1511 and is probably the most logical follow-up to the introductory course. It is taught using C, and content follows from linked lists at the end of COMP1511 with Abstract Data Types, Recursion, Trees, Graphs, Sorting and various other ADTs. Ashesh is a fine enough lecturer, but I spent most of the term watching Hayden Smith's recordings from 21T2.

The weekly schedule for COMP2521 loosely follows the same lecture + TLB + Weekly Labs and Weekly Quiz as COMP1511, with changes to the assessables. The weekly labs are now longer, and mostly just one or two larger exercises. These require more thinking than the average Level 1 COMP course lab exercise. The weekly quizzes are now theory-based MCQs as opposed to the practical exercises in COMP1511. The exam is much the same, but without that scaling difficulty for the most part. Assignments are often more tedious and time-consuming though. You can't just read the spec and start coding; taking the time to plan out your program and tackle it step by step can help alleviate the difficulty the course brings. Despite the difficulty increase, I do recommend taking this course immediately after COMP1511, since it is the most logical follow-up, and also opens up so many elective options that it's hard to ignore.

### COMP2511 â€“ Object-Oriented Design & Programming

- Term Taken: 22T3
- Lecturer in Term Taken: Ashesh Mahidadia
- Other Lecturers: None
- Prerequisite: COMP1531, COMP2521
- Difficulty: ðŸŸ  Hard

COMP2511 is the next big jump in difficulty after completing the first-year core courses. It is an introduction to object-oriented programming, using Java as its language of choice. The main topics are good design behaviours and some of the various design patterns that object-oriented programming follows. Once again, Ashesh is a fine enough lecturer, but there isn't anyone else that I know who lectures the course.

The weekly schedule for COMP2511 loosely follows the same lecture + TLB + Weekly Labs as first-year COMP courses, with changes to the assessables. The weekly labs are now much longer, and mostly just one or two larger exercises. I often found myself spending 2 or more hours on these labs, which was very different from my first-year experience. There are no weekly quizzes, and the exam is much the same, but without that scaling difficulty for the most part. Assignments are even more tedious and time-consuming than ever, as the assignment specs are often not very detailed, requiring many assumptions to be made (using the help of the forum). While interesting, all 3 of the assignments were a large time sink, especially the second one which was a paired assignment. I would recommend taking this around term 2 or 3 of your second year because it is such a large difficulty increase compared to the first-year courses, so taking some time to get your head wrapped around some electives may be a good idea to do first.

### COMP3121/3821 â€“ (Extended) Algorithms and Programming Techniques

- Term Taken: 22T1
- Lecturer in Term Taken: Abdallah Saffidine
- Other Lecturers: None
- Prerequisite: COMP2521 (65+ for COMP3821)
- Difficulty: ðŸŸ  Hard

COMP3121 and COMP3821 are very different courses from anything students would have done up to this point. These courses are all about algorithmic thinking and problem-solving, with no coding involved at all. The topics covered include divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithms, max-flow problems, dynamic programming, and reductions. However, the course content is extremely important and helps with any interview prep you may be undertaking.

The weekly schedule for these courses is very different from the first-year structure. For COMP3121, there are still two 2-hour lectures each week, but there is only one 1-hour tutorial and no recurring weekly work. Instead, there are four individual assignments on the different topics, which are very time-consuming and often quite tricky.

As you have probably noticed, COMP3821 is the extended version of COMP3121 and the one I took. The differences between the two are:

- COMP3821 teaches the content faster with pre-recorded lectures, and the main lectures are treated as consultations.
- The assignments in COMP3821 are harder, but worth less (10% each instead of 15% in COMP3121).
- There are additional group assignments in COMP3821 in the off-weeks between the individual assignments (worth 5% each, all they are is creating your own assignment questions, pretty fun tbh).
- There is a 10% participation component to COMP3821.

Considering doing one of these two offerings is core for CS and an elective for SENG, I would only recommend taking extended if you are confident, and enjoy, algorithms (a good sign is if you find COMP2521 fun), and if you can convince three other people to take it with you.

### COMP3900 â€“Â Computer Science Project

- Not taken yet

### COMP4920 â€“Â Professional Issues and Ethics in Information Technology

- Not taken yet

## COMP Electives I have taken

### COMP2041 â€“ Software Construction: Techniques and Tools

- Term Taken: 22T2
- Lecturer in Term Taken: Andrew Taylor
- Other Lecturers: None
- Prerequisite: COMP1511
- Difficulty: ðŸŸ¡ Medium

COMP2041 is a very interesting course that feels very much like a level 1 COMP course. The content focuses on Shell scripting for the first half, and then transitions into Python and various techniques using this language. I learnt a lot of skills that generally help with my approach to COMP assignments that aren't taught anywhere else. Andrew Taylor is a great lecturer, and I highly recommend taking this course.

The weekly schedule for COMP2041 follows the same lecture + TLB + Weekly Labs and Weekly Quiz as the level 1 COMP courses. The only real difference is the final exam only has programming questions in it. The assignments usually become 'easy to pass / credit, medium to Distinction, hard to HD' as is standard for Andrew Taylor courses. You could consider taking this in your first year, but it may be hard to fit around all the other level 1 core courses after COMP1511, and your MATH courses.
